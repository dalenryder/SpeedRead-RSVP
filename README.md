# SpeedRead-RSVP
Upload a PDF or Word file and read it at speed via RSVP. We flash words one at a time in a large, comfortable UI so your eyes don’t need to move.


    RSVP: words are shown sequentially at a set words-per-minute, you can adjust while reading.
    Pivot letter: we highlight an Optimal Recognition Point inside each word to help fixation.
    Natural rhythm: punctuation and paragraph breaks appear as separate ticks, enabling brief pauses.
    Controls: Play/Pause, configurable Jump Back, Forward one, Restart. Keyboard shortcuts listed in the footer.
    Privacy: Everything runs locally in your browser, no uploads.
    Tip: Start around 300–350 WPM; tweak text size; use Jump Back if something feels too quick.

How to use: download file, double click to run in browser. No extra software needed.
